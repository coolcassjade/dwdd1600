       <h2>History</h2>
       <p>The usage of makeup dates back to 6000 BCE, first used by the Egyptians. In ancient Greece, they used it to enhance natural features. Queens and Kings wore lots of makeup for status and beauty, especialy during the Renaissance era. The Renaissance/Elizabethan era also used makeup for performance art, as Shakespeare began writing his plays around this time. Beauty trends were constantly changing throughout history, but still used for the same 3 things.</p>

        <h2>Today</h2>
            <p>Makeup is still used the same ways today, but just slightly different compared to the past. Makeup has become accessible for anybody, no matter status, race, gender, or sexuality. Many use it to enhance their features to feel more confident, while others use it as a <strong>self-expressive</strong> art form. With the rise of <strong>social media</strong>, you will see it used more artistically. That's what makes it so <strong>versatile</strong>.  </p>

            <h2>Tips and Favorites</h2>
            <p>Everyone's skin and techniques are different, so these are just generalized <em>tips and favorites</em> of the author, Cassidy Copsey. </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Primer</em> is not inherently necessary in a makeup routine, but, depending on skintype, can be really helpful when creating a smooth face base. I personally like The Liquid Silk Canvas by Tatcha, but a more affordable option would be Baby Skin by Maybelline. </li>
                    <li><em>Foundation/concealer</em> helps to create an even skin tone and set a blank canvas. I use the Elf Camo Concealer. </li>
                    <li><em>Powder</em> sets the liquid face products and also helps set an even skin tone. I like the Loose Face Powder by Coty Airspun. 
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Bronzer/Contour</em> gives the face depth and color. The Belgian Waffle bronzer and highlight palette by BH Cosmetics is my favorite. </li>
                    <li><em>Blush</em> also brings color back to the face and emphasizes cheek bones. NYX has amazing powder blush.</li>
                    <li><em>Highlighter</em> highlights the points of the face and adds a bit of shimmer! Once again, the Belgian Waffle bronzer and highlight palette by BH Cosmetics is my favorite. </li>
                    <li><em>Brows</em> can be easily hidden in a full face of makeup, so it is important to brush them out and maybe fill them in! I used Benefit Gimme Brow.</li>
                    <li><em>Eyeshaow</em> can make the eyes stand out. I have too many eyeshaow palettes to name a favorite, but Morphe creates very affordable, high quality palettes.</li>
                    <li><em>Lashes</em> also make the eyes pop, regardless if you like a natural or big lash. My favorite mascara is Great Lash by Maybelline and my favorite false lashes are from Kiss.</li>
                    <li><em>Lip Liner</em> creates an outline for your lip shape and can create dimension. I used Shineloud Lip Liner by NYX.</li>
                    <li><em>Lipstick/Lipgloss</em> balances out the rest of the face. You can create too much attention to the eyes without any emphasis on the lips. NYX and Maybelline have amazing lip products.</li>
                    <li><em>Setting Spray</em> locks everything in. You don't want your masterpeice to come off easy, so setting spray helps it stay. I used De-Slick by Urban Decay.</li>
                </ul>
